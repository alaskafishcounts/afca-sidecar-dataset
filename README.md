# AFCA Sidecar Dataset Repository

This repository hosts special projects and supplementary data for the Alaska Fish Count App (AFCA) that are **NOT** fish count JSON files. This keeps the main fish count data repository clean while providing dedicated space for research projects, GPS data, GeoJSON files, and other supplementary datasets.
